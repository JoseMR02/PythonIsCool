    <h2>Not a Big Deal</h2>
  <p>
    These great upsides do come with a small cost however. Since the computer is left with more work than a low level language, it results in a slightly slower compiling time. All this means is that Python won't be used in situations where speed is number one priority. We'll leave that to other languages.
