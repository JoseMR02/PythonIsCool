  <h2>Too Many to Count</h2>
  <p> As mentioned before, Python is a high-level programing language. This allows for loose-language, meaning that you can type less and have the computer do some of the work for you, such as determining the data type of a variable. It can also take care of lower lever data management, making it easier to work with dynamic data.</p>
